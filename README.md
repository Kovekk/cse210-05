Cycle game!

Description:
This game is similar to the Tron bike game where 2 players play as bikes that leave a trail behind them. I you run into on of the trails then you lose the game and the bikes and trail turn white.

Project structure:
the game is structured in to different classes and pull code from all of the classes to make the game work. We used polymorphation in the program so tha we could use the same code in different areas and change it when and where we needed.

required software:
